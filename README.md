# Sparrow

A library with a collection of decorators and functions to functional programming. It's a library that I use in my projects and I decided to share it with the community. I hope you enjoy it.

This library solves problems and limitations that I have found programming in Python, it especially with the creation of functions and methods, adding behavior before and after the behavior of the functions, with first intention to be used in the composition of functions.
